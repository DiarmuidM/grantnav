  <h2 id="search_box">{% trans "How does the GrantNav search box work?" %}</h2>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}GrantNav provides a freetext search box which allows you to explore the data. There are three search patterns to choose from and these work in the following ways:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="filters">{% trans "How do the GrantNav filters work?" %}</h2>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}GrantNav has filters which appear on the left hand side of the search results. These work in relation to certain fields in the 360Giving Standard in the following ways:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="additional_data">{% trans "Additional data and GrantNav" %}</h2>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}GrantNav uses <a href="/datasets/">grants data</a> that is being published to the <a href="http://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/">360Giving Standard</a>. It is updated on a monthly basis. When the data is imported, we undertake
    two processes that mean we can provide additional data.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h3 id="location_data">{% trans "GrantNav and Location Data" %}</h3>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}When we import this data, we look at the Location information associated with the Recipient Organisation. This data can vary across publishers.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h4>{% trans "When a Recipient Org:Postcode is provided" %}</h4>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}We use the postcode to add Ward, District and Region <a href="/datasets/">codes</a> to the data. This is used in the relevant filters in GrantNav, and also Ward, District and Region names are included in the download files.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h4>{% trans "When a Recipient Org:Postcode is missing" %}</h4>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}If other types of administrative geography are included in the data (such as District or Ward codes) then we attempt to match it to relevant areas. Again, these are used in the filters and the names and codes are included in the download files.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h3 id="charity_names">{% trans "GrantNav and Charity Names" %}</h3>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}It’s useful for people to see multiple grants associated with a single organisation together in GrantNav. To do this, we rely on publishers including the relevant company, charity or other registration number in the Recipient Org: Identifier
    field.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}When we import data into GrantNav, we aim to match these identifiers, in order to provide pages that bring together grants from different publishers, even if they spell the recipient names differently.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}When we undertook research to do this, we found that quite often registered charities were given different names by various publishers. Even if the Recipient Org: Identifier reference were the exact same, the name given was often different,
    e.g. “Salford Lads Club” vs “Salford Lads & Girls Club”.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}In order to help users, we therefore utilise the data available from the Charity Commission for England and Wales. We look for the official name on this register. With this, we populate the Recipient Org: Name field, which in turn is
    used in the relevant filter on GrantNav. However, we also maintain the original name from the publisher, and use that in the grant page and freetext search.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="export_files">{% trans "What is covered in the GrantNav export files?" %}</h2>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}Data can be exported from GrantNav searches, and from views of funders and recipients, in either CSV or JSON formats. You can also <a href="/developers/">download the whole data set</a> using in GrantNav.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h3 id="export_search">{% trans "Exporting from a search" %}</h3>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}When you export data from a GrantNav search the data provided uses the same field names as the <a href="http://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/">360Giving Standard</a>. This is provided in a single file - in the case of the CSV
    file there will be multiple columns for fields that may have more than one value for some grants, such as geographic terms. Please note that not all fields in the 360Giving Standard are included in the GrantNav export files.{% endblocktrans %}
